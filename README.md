# MarsX
Here is the project MarsX for evaluation. It provided two post and one get routes.

# A brief description of project
A new application is being built to spec by a crack team of coders out in orbit around Mars. You are part of that team, and your mission is to develop an application where Mars leadership team can view data from CDC! They are worried about the new infection spreading based on vaccination rates, and they would like to see historical data to get more context. Here are their requirements:
Build data ingestion pipeline that takes data from data.cdc.gov and delivers an API for frontend data visualization.
Should store data in some persistent storage and be able to be refreshed when the data sets are available (SQLite, mongo, or Postgres)
Should be able to filter by either National or Jurisdictional
Should filter off vaccination status, intent and demographics
Consider the data dirty - so some validation and transformation in the pipeline is required.
NICE TO HAVE: Should have authentication
